# 🎧 Spotify Data Analysis Dashboard  

## 📌 Introduction  
We usually wait until the end of the year for **Spotify Wrapped**, but I was curious about my listening habits *before* December.  
So, I created my own **Spotify Data Analysis** for **January 2025 – August 2025** to uncover insights into my music taste, listening patterns, and top tracks.  

This project highlights the **end-to-end data journey**:  
- Requesting my personal data from Spotify  
- Cleaning & preparing the dataset  
- Building an interactive **Power BI dashboard** with custom visuals  
- Extracting meaningful insights about my listening behavior
